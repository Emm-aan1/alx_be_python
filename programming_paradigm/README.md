# Programming Paradigms üìö

This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various programming paradigms, with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) and related concepts. The examples include a simple bank account class, a library management system, and tools for division calculations and unit testing.

## Files

### `bank_account.py` üè¶
- **Description**: Creates a simple bank account class. This script demonstrates the basics of class creation and method definitions, showcasing how to manage bank account details.

### `library_management.py` üìñ
- **Description**: Implements basic OOP for a library management system. This script models a library with various functionalities, illustrating the use of OOP principles to manage books and library operations.

### `main-0.py` üöÄ
- **Description**: Contains a simple bank account class implementation. This is an earlier version of `main.py`, showcasing the development of a basic bank account class.

### `main.py` üöÄ
- **Description**: Implements basic OOP for a library management system. This script is a more refined version of `main-0.py`, providing a complete example of a library management system using OOP principles.

### `robust_division_calculator.py` ‚ûó
- **Description**: A robust division calculator that handles command line arguments. This script demonstrates how to create a division calculator that can be executed with various inputs from the command line.

### `simple_calculator.py` üî¢
- **Description**: Provides a simple calculator class with basic arithmetic operations. This script showcases how to create a calculator class and implement fundamental operations.

### `test_simple_calculator.py` üß™
- **Description**: Contains unit tests for the `simple_calculator.py` class. This script demonstrates how to write and run unit tests to verify the functionality of the simple calculator class.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts:
1. **Run Python Files**: Navigate to this folder and execute the desired Python file.
2. **Command Line Arguments**: For scripts like `robust_division_calculator.py`, you can pass command line arguments to test different scenarios.
3. **Unit Testing**: Use a test framework (e.g., `unittest`) to run the unit tests in `test_simple_calculator.py` to ensure the functionality of `simple_calculator.py`.
