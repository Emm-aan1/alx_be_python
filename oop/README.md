# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🏛️

Welcome to the "Object-Oriented Programming" folder! This directory includes Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in object-oriented programming. From class methods to polymorphism, these examples will help you grasp the core principles of OOP.

## Files

### `book_class.py` 📚
- **Description**: Dive into Python magic methods and their usage. This script explores how to implement special methods in classes to handle operations like string representation and object initialization.

### `class_static_methods_demo.py` 📜
- **Description**: Demonstrates the use of class methods and static methods in Python. Learn how to define and use these methods within classes and understand their differences and use cases.

### `library_system.py` 📖
- **Description**: Showcases mastering inheritance and composition in Python. This script models a simple library system, illustrating how to use inheritance and composition to build complex systems.

### `main.py` 🛠️
- **Description**: Contains examples demonstrating class methods, static methods, and other OOP concepts. It serves as the entry point for running various demonstrations provided in this folder.

### `polymorphism_demo.py` 🔄
- **Description**: Explores polymorphism and method overriding. This script shows how different classes can share the same method name and how method overriding works in inheritance hierarchies.

## Getting Started

To run any of these scripts, navigate to this folder and execute the desired Python file. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Each script is designed to be executed independently to demonstrate specific OOP concepts.
