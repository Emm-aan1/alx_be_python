# Python Introduction 📘

This folder contains Python scripts designed to introduce and practice fundamental programming concepts. The examples include basic arithmetic operations, user input handling, and simple calculations.

## Files

### `basic_operations.py` ➕➖✖️➗
- **Description**: Contains exercises for basic arithmetic operations. This script covers fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### `finance_calculator.py` 💰
- **Description**: Provides updates to a finance calculator. This script includes functionality for various financial calculations, including interest and investment-related computations.

### `future_age_calculator.py` 📅
- **Description**: A user input age calculator that estimates a person's age in the future. This script takes user input for the current age and calculates the age for a specified future year.

### `hours_to_seconds.py` ⏱️➡️⏲️
- **Description**: Converts hours to seconds. This simple script demonstrates how to perform unit conversions by taking an input of hours and converting it to seconds.

### `rectangle_area.py` 📏
- **Description**: Calculates the area of a rectangle. This script takes the dimensions of a rectangle (length and width) and computes its area.

### `simple_interest.py` 💵
- **Description**: A calculator for simple interest. This script computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts:
1. **Run Python Files**: Navigate to this folder and execute the desired Python file to see the output.
2. **User Input**: For scripts requiring user input (e.g., `future_age_calculator.py`), follow the prompts to enter the necessary data.
3. **Modify Code**: Feel free to modify and experiment with the scripts to better understand basic Python programming concepts.
